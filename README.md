# Image Classification Model

This repository contains an image classification project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into different categories. The model is built with TensorFlow and Keras and trained on a dataset of labeled images.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains images belonging to five different categories:
- **Category 1**: Daisy
- **Category 2**: Dandelion
- **Category 3**: Rose
- **Category 4**: Sunflower
- **Category 5**: Tulip

The dataset is organized into training and validation directories, with subfolders for each category. The images are resized to 180x180 pixels and augmented during training to improve model generalization.

## Libraries Installed

Make sure to install the following libraries before running the project:

- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **SciPy**: For scientific computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For additional machine learning utilities.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the training results.
- **Flask**: For serving the model in a web application.
